# Intro  
This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.

## Instructor's Note  
"*We believe that the key word in Data Science is 'science'. Our course track is focused on providing you with three things:*  
1) *An introduction to the key ideas behind working with data in a scientific way that will produce new and reproducible insight*  
2) *An introduction to the tools that will allow you to execute on a data analytic strategy, from raw data in a database to a completed report with interactive graphics*  
3) *Giving you plenty of hands on practice so you can learn the techniques for yourself.*  
  
*Regression Models represents a both fundamental and foundational component of the series, and it presents the single most practical data analysis toolset. Using only a bare minimum of mathematics, we will attempt to provide you with the fundamentals for the application and practice of regression.*  
*We are excited about the opportunity to attempt to scale Data Science education. We intend for the courses to be self-contained, fast-paced, and interactive, and we intend to run them frequently to give people with busy schedules the opportunity to work on material at their own pace.*

# Least Squares and Linear Regression  
## Regression  
### Introduction to Regression  
* The simplicity and intrepretability offered by regression models should make them a first tool of choice for any practical problem.  
* First discovered by **[Francis Galton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton)** who coined most of the terminology we use today.  

#### Relevant Simply Statistics Post  
**[Simply Statistics is a blog by Jeff Leek, Roger Peng and Rafael Irizarry, who wrote this post](https://simplystatistics.org/2013/01/28/data-supports-claim-that-if-kobe-stops-ball-hogging-the-lakers-will-win-more/)**  
![Percent of shots by Kobe to Point Differential](./Images/kobelakers_lm_plot.png)  
  
* "Data supports claim that if Kobe stops ball hogging the Lakers will win more"  
* "Linear regression suggests that an increase of 1% in percent of shots taken by Kobe results in a drop of 1.16 (+/- 0.22) in score differential."  
        + Standard error given as "+/- 0.22"  

#### Questions for this Class  
In reference to Galton's parent/children height data, which can be accessed from the `galton` dataset in the `UsingR` package.  
Consider trying to answer the following kinds of questions:  
* To use the parents' heights to predict childrens' heights.  
* To try to find a parsimonious (explain the data), easily described mean relationship between parent and children's heights.  
* To investigate the variation in childrens' heights that appears unrelated to parents' heights (residual variation).  
* To quantify what impact genotype information has beyond parental height in explaining child height.  
* To figure out how/whether and what assumptions are needed to generalize findings beyond the data in question.  
* Why do children of very tall parents tend to be tall, but a little shorter than their parents and why children of very short parents tend to be short, but a little taller than their parents? (This is a famous question called "Regression to the mean".)  

### Introduction to Basic Least Squares  
* Let's look at the data first used by Francis Galton in 1885.  
* Galton was a statistician who invented the term and concepts of regression and correlation, founded the journal Biometrika, and was the cousin of Charles Darwin.  
* Let's look at the marginal (parents disregarding children and children disregarding parents) distributions first.  
        + Parent distribution is all heterosecual couples.  
        + Correction for gender via multiplying female heights by 1.08.  
        + Overplotting is an issue from discretization.  
```{r message=FALSE}
library(UsingR); data(galton); library(reshape2); library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
long <- melt(galton)
plot <- ggplot(long, aes(x = value, fill = variable)) +
        geom_histogram(colour = "#000000", binwidth = 1)
plot + facet_grid(.~variable)
```
  
#### Finding the Middle via Least Squares  
* Consider only the children's heights  
        + How could one describe the "middle"?  
        + One definition, let $Y_i$ be the height of child $i$ for $i = 1,...,n=928$, then define the middle as the value of $\mu$ that minimizes  
$\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \mu)^2$  
* This is the physical center of mass of the histogram.  
* The result of this is that $\mu = \bar{Y}$  
```{r}
ggplot(galton, aes(x = child)) +
        geom_histogram(fill = "salmon", colour = "#000000", binwidth = 1) +
        geom_vline(xintercept = mean(galton$child), size = 3)
```
  
* The above plot of child heights has a mean of `r mean(galton$child)`


### Technical Details  
Proof that $\bar{Y}$ is the minimizer for $\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \mu)^2$  
$\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \mu)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y} + \bar{Y} - \mu)^2\\ =\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar{Y}^2 + 2\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar{Y})(\bar{Y}-\mu) +\sum_{i=1}^n(\bar{Y} -\mu)^2\\ =\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2+2(\bar{Y}-\mu)\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar{Y})+\sum_{i=1}^n(\bar{Y}-\mu)^2\\ =\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2+2(\bar{Y}-\mu)(\sum_{i=1}^nY_i-n\bar{Y})+\sum_{i=1}^n(\bar{Y}-\mu)^2\\ =\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2+0+\sum_{i=1}^n(\bar{Y}-\mu)^2\\ \geq \sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2$  
  
Therefore, $\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \mu)^2$ is minimized when $\bar{Y}=\mu$  

### Introductory Data Example  
#### Comparing Childrens' Heights and Their Parents' Heights  
```{r}
ggplot(galton, aes(x = parent, y = child)) + geom_point()
```
  
* These points are overplotted, there are multiple overlays at each point, so let's make a better plot  
```{r}
freqData <- as.data.frame(table(galton$child, galton$parent))
names(freqData) <- c("child", "parent", "freq")
freqData$child <- as.numeric(as.character(freqData$child))
freqData$parent <- as.numeric(as.character(freqData$parent))
plot <- ggplot(filter(freqData, freq > 0), aes(x = parent, y = child)) +
        scale_size(range = c(2, 20), guide = "none") +
        geom_point(colour = "grey50", 
                   aes(size = freq + 20, show_guide = FALSE)) +
        geom_point(aes(colour = freq, size = freq)) +
        scale_colour_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "#FFFFFF")
plot
```
  
#### Regression Through the Origin  
* Suppose that $X_i$ are the parents' heights  
* Consider picking the slope $\beta$ that minimizes  
$\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-X_i\beta)^2$  
* This is exactly using the orgin as a pivot point picking the line that minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances of the points to the line  
* Subtract the means so that the orgin is the mean of the parent and children's heights  
        + A plot with a regression line going through true (0,0) often doesn't make sense, so subtracting the means realigns the orgin to be in the middle of the data  
```{r}
freqData <- as.data.frame(table(galton$parent - mean(galton$parent),
                                galton$child - mean(galton$child)))
names(freqData) <- c("child", "parent", "freq") 
freqData$child <- as.numeric(as.character(freqData$child))
freqData$parent <- as.numeric(as.character(freqData$parent))
plot <- ggplot(filter(freqData, freq > 0), aes(x = parent, y = child)) +
        scale_size(range = c(2, 20), guide = "none") +
        geom_point(colour = "grey50", 
                   aes(size = freq + 20)) + 
        geom_point(aes(colour = freq, size = freq)) +
        scale_colour_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "#FFFFFF") +
        geom_abline(intercept = 0, 
                    
                slope = lm(
                        I(child - mean(child)) ~ 
                                I(parent - mean(parent)) - 1, 
                        data = galton)$coeff,
                
                    size = 3)
plot
```
  
* In the next few lectures we'll talk about why this is the solution  
```{r}
lm(I(child - mean(child)) ~ I(parent - mean(parent)) - 1, data = galton)
```
  
* The `I` function just ignores the intercept, since we already adjusted for that  
* We can also fit a line to an un-adjusted model  
```{r}
freqData <- as.data.frame(table(galton$child, galton$parent))
names(freqData) <- c("child", "parent", "freq")
freqData$child <- as.numeric(as.character(freqData$child))
freqData$parent <- as.numeric(as.character(freqData$parent))
plot <- ggplot(filter(freqData, freq > 0), aes(x = parent, y = child)) +
        scale_size(range = c(2, 20), guide = "none" ) +
        geom_point(colour = "grey50", aes(size = freq + 20)) +
        geom_point(aes(colour = freq, size = freq)) +
        scale_colour_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "#FFFFFF")                    
lm1 <- lm(galton$child ~ galton$parent)
plot + geom_abline(intercept = coef(lm1)[1], slope = coef(lm1)[2], 
                   size = 3, colour = "#888888")
```
  
  
### Lesson with `swirl()`: Introduction  
* Another way we could have gotten past overlapping plot points is to use the `jitter` function  
```{r}
plot(jitter(child,4) ~ parent, galton)
```



## Linear Least Squares  
* Also called **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**; it fits a line through some data.  

### Notation and Background  
#### Notation  
* The empirical mean is defined as  
$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$  
* If we subtract the mean from data points, we get data that has a mean of 0. That is, if we define:  
$\tilde{X}_i=X_i-\bar{X}$.  
        + The mean of $\tilde{X}_i$ is 0  
* This process is called "**centering**" the random variables  
* Recall from the previous lecture that the mean is the elast squares solution for minimizing $\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\mu)^2$  
  
#### The Emprical Standard Deviation adn Variance  
* Define the empirical variance as  
$S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}(\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 - n\bar{X}^2)$  
* The empirical standard deviation is defined as $S = \sqrt{S^2}$.  
        + Notice that the standard deviation has the same units as the data.  
* The data defined by $\frac{X_i}{s}$ have an empirical standard deviation of 1. 
        + This is called "**scaling**" the data.  

#### Normalization  
* The data defined by  
$Z_i = \frac{X_i-\bar{X}}{s}$  
have an empirical mean of 0 and an empirical standard deviation of 1.  
* The process of centering then scaling the data is called "**normalizing**" the data.  
* Normalized data are centered at 0 and have units equal to standard deviations of the original data.  
* For example, a value of 2 from normalized data is saying that data point was two standard deviations larger than the mean.  

#### The Empirical Covariance  
* Consider now when we have pairs of data, $(X_i, Y_i)$  
* Their empirical covariance is  
$Cov(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}{n}(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})\\ =\frac{1}{n-1}(\sum_{i=1}^nX_i Y_i - n\bar{X}\bar{Y})$  
* The correlation is defined as  
$Cor(X,Y) = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{S_x S_y}$  
        + Where $S_x$ and $S_y$ are the estimates of standard deviaitons for the X observations and Y observations, respectively.  
        
#### Some Facts About Correlation  
* $Cor(X,Y) = Cor(Y, X)$  
* $-1 \leq Cor(X,Y) \leq 1$  
* $Cor(X,Y) = 1$ and $Cor(X,Y) = -1$ only when the $X$ or $Y$ observations fall perfectly on a positive or negative sloped line, repectively.  
* $Cor(X,Y)$ measures the strength of the linear relationship between the $X$ and $Y$ data, with stronger relationships as $Cor(X,Y)$ heads towards either -1 or 1  {
* $Cor(X,Y)=0$ implies no linear relationship  


### Linear Least Squares  
#### Fitting the Best Line  
* Let $Y_i$ be the $i^{th}$ child's height and $X_i$ be the $i^{th}$ (average over the pair of) parents' heights.  
* Consider finding the best line   
        + Child's Height = $\beta_0$ + Parent's Height * $\beta_1$  
$\sum_{i=1}^{n} {Y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i)}^2$  
  
  
* the least squares model fit to the line $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$ through the data pairs $(X_i, Y_i)$ with $Y_i$ as the outcome obtains the line $Y=\hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} X$ where  
$\hat{\beta_1} = Cor(Y,X)\frac{Sd(Y)}{Sd(X)}$  
$\hat{\beta_0}=\bar{Y}-\hat{\beta_1}\bar{X}$  
* $\hat{\beta_1}$ has the units of $Y/X$, $\hat{\beta_0}$ has the units of $Y$.  
* The line passes through the point $(\bar{X},\bar{Y})$  
* The slope of the regression line with $X$ as the outcome and $Y$ as the predictor is $\frac{Cor(Y,X)Sd(X)}{Sd(Y)}$  
* The slope si the same one you would get if you centered the data, $(X_i - \bar{X}, Y_i-\bar{Y})$, and made a regression through the orgin  
* If you normalized the data, $(\frac{X_i-\bar{X}}{Sd(X)}, \frac{Y_i-\bar{Y}}{Sd(Y)})$, the slope is $Cor(Y, X)$  

### Linear Least Squares Coding Example  
```{r}
y <- galton$child
x <- galton$parent
beta1 <- cor(y,x) * sd(y) / sd(x)
beta0 <- mean(y) - beta1 * mean(x)

#Showing the computations by hand are the same as coef from lm function
rbind(c(beta0, beta1), coef(lm(y~x)))
```
  
* `lm` stands for *linear model*  
```{r}
#The slope is the same in centered data  
yc <- y - mean(y)
xc <- x - mean(x)
beta1 <- sum(yc * xc) / sum(xc^2)
c(beta1, coef(lm(y ~ x))[2])
lm(yc ~ xc - 1)$coef #minus 1 gets rid of intercept
```

```{r}
#Normalizing variables results in the slope being the correlation
yn <- (y - mean(y))/sd(y)
xn <- (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
results <- cbind(cor(y,x), lm(yn ~ xn)$coef[2], cor(yn, xn))
colnames(results) <- c("cor(y,x)", "Slope(yn ~ xn)", "cor(yn, xn)")
results
```

#### Adding a Linear Regression to ggplot  
```{r}
plot <- ggplot(filter(freqData, freq > 0), aes(parent, child)) +
        scale_size(range = c(2, 20), guide = "none") +
        geom_point(colour = "grey50", aes(size = freq + 20)) +
        geom_point(aes(colour = freq, size = freq)) +
        scale_colour_gradient(low = "#5BC2E7", high = "#FFFFFF")

#Adding smoother
#y ~ x is assumed if not given
plot + geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) 
```
  
* A confidence interval is also given around the line automaticly

## Regression to the Mean  
### Regression to the Mean  
* $P(Y < x|X = x)$ gets bigger as $x$ tends towards very large values.  
        + Similarly $P(Y>x|X=x)$ gets bigger as $x$ tends towards very small values.  
* Regression line is like the intrisic part of this relation  
        + Unless $Cor(Y,X) = 1$ the intrinsic part isn't perfect  
* Suppose we center $X$ (child's hieght) and $Y$ (parent's height) so that they both have a mean of 0  
        + Then, recall, our regression line passes through $(0,0)$  
* We then normalize the data points too  
        + The slope of the regression line is $Cor(Y,X)$, regardless of which variable is the outcome (since both $sd$s are 1)  
* If the outcome is plotted on the horizontal axis the slope of the least squares line will be $\frac{1}{Cor(Y,X)}$  

#### Plotting the Regression Implicitly  
```{r}
library(UsingR); data(father.son)
y <- father.son$sheight
x <- father.son$fheight
y <- (y - mean(y)) / sd(y)
x <- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
rho <- cor(x, y) #rho is std greek letter for correlations  
plot <- ggplot(data.frame(Father = x, Son = y), aes(Father, Son)) +
        geom_point(size = 6, colour = "#000000", alpha = 0.2) +
        geom_point(size = 4, colour = "salmon", alpha = 0.2) +
        xlim(-4,4) + 
        ylim(-4,4) + #Std. norm being +/- 4 is very unlikely
        geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
        geom_vline(xintercept = 0, alpha = 0.5) +
        geom_hline(yintercept = 0, alpha = 0.5)
plot + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = rho, size = 2, colour = "#5BC2E7")
plot + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1/rho, size = 2, colour = "#7E2CB5")
```
* The blue line is where the Father's height is the predictor and the Son's height is the outcome  
* The purple line is where the Son's hieght is the predictor and the Father's height is the outcome (`1/rho` because the outcome is on the horizontal axis)

### Lesson with `swirl()`: Residuals  
* A residual is the distance between the actual data point and the regression line.  
        + I've previously heard it also called the "Unexplained Variation" since the distance form the mean value to data point is the "Total Variation (from the mean)", then the distance from the mean to reg. line is the "Explained Variation".  
* You can get some info on a data sets residuals by calling `summary` on the results of `lm` as seen below  
```{r}
summary(lm(child ~ parent, galton))
```
* `est` will return the estimate, $\hat{y}$  
* `sqe` will calculate the sum of the squared residuals, also called the Residual Sum of Squares  
* var(residuals) = var(data) - var(estimate)  
        + As such the variance of residuals is always less than the variance of data  
* The residuals shouldn't be correlated to either factor, if it did this may imply a diffrent relationship is present

* $\beta_1 = Cor(Y,X)\frac{sd(Y)}{sd(X)}$  
* $\gamma_1 = Cor(Y,X)\frac{sd(X)}{sd(Y)}$  
* $\frac{\beta_1}{\gamma_1} = \frac{Cor(Y,X)*sd(Y)/sd(X)}{Cor(Y,X)*sd(X)/sd(Y)} = \frac{sd(Y)*sd(Y)}{sd(X)*sd(X)} = \frac{Var(Y)}{Var(X)}$  
  
# Linear Regression & Multivariable Regression  
## Statistical Linear Regression Models  
### Statistical Linear Regression Models  
#### Basic Regression Model with Additive Gaussian Errors  
* Consider developing a probabilistic model for linear regression  
$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$  
        + Here the $\epsilon_i$ are assumed iid $N(0, \sigma^2)$  
                - Can be thought of as accumulated variables that aren't modeled by act on the response as iid gaussian errors
        + $E[Y_i | X_i = x_i] = \mu_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$  
        + $Var(Y_i | X_i = x_i) = \sigma^2$  


### Interpreting Coefficients  
#### Intercept  
* $\beta_0$ is the expected value of the response when the predictor is 0  
$E[Y|X = 0] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times 0 = \beta_0$  
        + This isn't always a value of interest, for example when $X = 0$ is impossible (x represents weight) or far outside of the range of data.  
* A solution to non-interpretable intercepts is to shift the equation by some value, $a$ then define a new intercept, $\tilde{\beta_0}$.  
$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i+\epsilon_i=\beta_0 + a\beta_1+\beta_1(X_i-a)+\epsilon_i = \tilde{\beta_0}+\beta_1(X_i-a)+\epsilon_i$  
        + Shifting your $X$ values by value $a$ changes the intercept, but not the slope.  
        + Often $a$ is set to $\bar{X}$ so that the intercept is inteerpretted as the expected response at the average X value.  

#### Slope  
* $\beta_1$ is the expected change in response for a 1 unit change in the predictor  
* Consider the impact of changing the units of $X$.  
$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + \epsilon_i = \beta_o + \frac{\beta_1}{a}(X_ia) + \epsilon_i = \beta_0 + \tilde{\beta_1}(X_ia) + \epsilon_i$  
        + Since $\beta_1$ is in units of Y/X we divide by the factor, $a$, that we're multiplying with $X_i$.  
* Example: $X$ is height in *m* and $Y$ is weight in *kg*. Then $\beta_1$ is *kg/m*. Converting $X$ to *cm* implies multiplying $X$ by 100*cm/m*. To get $\beta_1$ in the right units, we have to divide by 100*cm/m* to get it to have the right units.  
$Xm \times \frac{100cm}{m} = (100X)cm$ and $\beta_1 \frac{kg}{m} \times \frac{1m}{100cm} = (\frac{\beta_1}{100})\frac{kg}{cm}$

### Linear Regression for Prediction  
* We can get a prediction for Y, $\hat{y}$ by plugging in the X that we want into our model  
$\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}X_i$  

#### Example using diamond Data  
* The data in this example is diamond prices (in Sigapore dollars) and diamond weight in carats (1 carat = 0.2 g).  
```{r}
library(UsingR); data(diamond); library(tidyverse)
plot <- ggplot(diamond, aes(carat, price)) +
        xlab("Mass (carats)") +
        ylab("Price (SIN $)") +
        geom_point(size = 6, colour = "#000000", alpha = 0.2) +
        geom_point(size = 5, colour = "#5BC2E7", alpha = 0.2)
plot + geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "#000000", formula = y ~ x)
```
#### Creating a Model  
```{r}
# Fitting the linear regression model
fit <- lm(price ~ carat, data = diamond)
coef(fit)
```

* We estimate an expected 3721.02 (SIN) dollar increase in price for every increase of 1 carat in mass of diamonds.
* The intercept, -259.63 is the expected price of a 0 carat diamond, which doesn't make sense to interpret.  
        + As such we'll mean center our reg. line  
#### Centering Model on the Mean
```{r}
cfit <- lm(price ~ I(carat - mean(carat)), data = diamond)
cfit$coef
```
* To do arithmetic operations in the formula in `lm` you have to surround the operation with the `I` function  
* The slope has not changed  
* The intercept has changed to $500$, the expected price for the average sized diamond of the data (`r round(mean(diamond$carat), 3)` carats).  
  
#### Changing Units in the Model  
* Change unit to 1/10 of a carrat  
```{r}
tenthfit <- lm(price ~ I(carat * 10), data = diamond)
coef(tenthfit)
```
* So now the slope is interpretted as a `r round(tenthfit$coef[2], 2)` dollar increase for every additional 0.1 carrats of diamond.  

#### Estimating a Value  
```{r}
newDiamonds <- c(0.16, 0.27, 0.34)
#Computing manually
fit$coef[1] + fit$coef[2] * newDiamonds

#Using predict function
results <- predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(carat = newDiamonds))
names(results) <- as.character(newDiamonds) #renaming not required
results
```

```{r}
#Using predict without `newdata` will return y-hat for given x values
predict(fit)
plot + geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "#000000", formula = y ~ x) +
        geom_point(aes(y = as.numeric(predict(fit))),
                   size = 3, color = "#FF0000", shape = 17)
```

## Residuals  
### Residuals  
* The residuals are the variation from the regression line, that is left unexplained by our model, $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i + \epsilon_i$ where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$.  
* Observed outcome $i$ is $Y_i$ at predictor value $X_i$  
* Predicted outcome $i$ is $\hat{Y}_i$ at predictor value $X_i$ is $\hat{Y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_i$  
* Residual, $e_i$,  is the difference between the observed and predicted outcome: $e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i$.  
        + This is the vertical distanc ebetween the observed data point and the regression line  
* Least squares minimizes these residuals, the equation $\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2$  
* The $e_i$ can be thought of as estimates of the $\epsilon_i$  

#### Properties of the Residuals  
* $E[e_i] = 0$  
* If an intercept is included, $\sum_{i=1}^n e_i = 0$  
* If a regressor variable, $X_i$, is included in the model $\sum_{i=1}^n e_iX_i = 0$  
* Residuals are useful for investigating poor model fit  
        + Residual plots can highlight these poor fits  
* Residuals can be though of as the outcome ($Y$) with the linear association of the predictor ($X$) removed.  
* One differentiates residual variation (variation after removing the predictor) from systematic variation (variation explained by the regression model).  


### Residuals, Coding Example  
* Using diamond dataset again  
```{r}
data("diamond")
y <- diamond$price 
x <- diamond$carat
fit <- lm(y ~ x)

e <- resid(fit) #Getting residuals

yhat <- predict(fit)

# Showing residuals are the same as y - yhat (within a floating point error)
max(abs(e - (y - yhat)))

# And again, but manually entering the equation for yhat
max(abs(e - (y - (coef(fit)[1] + coef(fit)[2] * x))))

#Showing sum of resid and resid*x are both 0
sum(e)
sum(e * x)
```

```{r}
#Plotting the residuals 
plot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y, resid = e), aes(x, resid)) +
        
        geom_segment(aes(xend = x, yend = 0), colour = "#FF0000") +
        
        geom_point(size = 2, colour = "#5BC2E7", alpha = 0.5) +
        xlab("Mass (carats)") +
        ylab("Residuals (SIN $)") +
        geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "#000000")
plot
```

#### Using Residual Plot to Detect a Poorly Fit Model  
* We're going to generate some data that looks linear but actually has an underlying relation to it that will become more apparent after plotting the residuals  
```{r}
set.seed(1618033)
x <- runif(100, -3, 3)
y <- x + sin(x) + #Y is related with sin(x), lm will expose the sin(x) rel.
        rnorm(100, sd = .2) # For noise
plot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y), aes(x,y)) +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "#000000") +
        geom_point(size = 7, colour = "#000000", alpha = 0.4) +
        geom_point(size = 5, colour = "#FF0000", alpha = 0.4)

residplot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x, resid = resid(lm(y ~ x))), 
                    aes(x, resid)) +
        geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
        geom_point(size = 7, colour = "#000000", alpha = 0.4) +
        geom_point(size = 5, colour = "#FF0000", alpha = 0.4) +
        labs(x = "X", y = "Residual")
plot
residplot
```

* A secondary pattern can be seen in the residual plot, indicating there might be a better model than a line.  

#### Detecting Heteroskedasticity with a Residual Plot  
```{r}
x <- runif(100, 0, 6)
y <- x + rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 0.001 * x)#sd increases as x increases
plot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y), aes(x,y)) +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "black") +
        geom_point(size = 7, colour = "#000000", alpha = 0.4) +
        geom_point(size = 5, colour = "#FF0000", alpha = 0.4)
residplot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x, resid = resid(lm(y ~ x))), 
                    aes(x,resid)) +
        geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "#000000") +
        geom_point(size = 7, colour = "#000000", alpha = 0.4) +
        geom_point(size = 5, colour = "#FF0000", alpha = 0.4)
plot
residplot
```
* The plot looks linear, but plotting the residuals reveals an underlying pattern


### Residual Variance  
#### Estimating Residual Variaiton  
* Model: $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$ where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$  
* The mean linear estimate of $\sigma^2$ is $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^ne_i^2$, the average squared residual  
* Most people use:  
$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-2}\sum_{i=1}^ne_i^2$  
        + with $n-2$ instead of $n$ so that $E[\hat{\sigma}^2]=\sigma^2$  

#### Diamond Example  
```{r}
y <- diamond$price
x <- diamond$carat
n <- length(y)

#Solving resid s.d. implicitly
sqrt(sum(resid(fit)^2) / (n - 2))

#Getting resid deviation with functions
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(fit)$sigma

#You can see the value in the summary print out here:
summary(fit)
```

#### Summarizing Variation  
* **Total Variability** - the variability around an intercept (mean only regression)
        + $\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2$  
        + Sum of Regression & Error Variability  
* **Regression Variability** - the variability that is explained by adding the predictor  
        + $\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2$  
* **Error Variability** - what's leftover around the regression line  
        + $\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \hat{Y})^2$  

#### R Squared, the Coefficent of Determination  
* R squared is the percentage of the total variability that is explained by the linear relationship with the predictor  
$R^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}$  
* $R^2$ is the percentage of variation explained by the regression model  
* $0 \leq R^2 \leq 1$  
* $R^2$ is the sample correlation squared  
* $R^2$ can bea  misleading summary of model fit  
        + Deleting data can inflate $R^2$  
        + (For later,) Adding terms to a regression model always increases $R^2$  
* Execute `example(anscombe)` to see the following data:  
        + Basically same mean and variance of X and Y  
        + Identical correlations (hence the same $R^2$ value)  
        + Same linear regression relationship

## Inference in Regression  
### Inference in Regression  
#### Recall Our Model and Fitted Values  
* Model:  
        + $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i+\epsilon_i$  
        + $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$, an error term  
        + $\hat{\beta}_1 = Cor(Y, X) \frac{Sd(Y)}{Sd(X)}$  
        + $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1\bar{X}$  
        
* We assume that the true model is known for most of this course  

#### Review Some Statistical Inference Concepts  
* Statistics like $\frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\theta}}}$ often have the following properties:  
        + Is normally distributed and ahs a finite sample Student's T distribution if the estimated variance is repalced with a sample estimate (under normality assumptions).  
        + Can be used to test $H_0 : \theta = \theta_0$ versus $H_a : \theta >,<,\neq \theta_0$  
        + Can be used to create a confidence interval for $\theta$ via $\hat{\theta} \pm Q_{1-\alpha/2}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\theta}}$ where $Q_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the relevant quantile from either a normal or T distribution  
* In the case of regression with iid sampling assumptions and normal errors, out inferences will follow very similarily to what was discussed in the inference class.  
* Under assumptions on the ways in which the $X$ values are collected the iid sampling model, and mean model, the nromal results hold to create intervals and confidence intervals  

#### Explanation  
* Variance of our regression slope, $\sigma_{\hat{\beta_1}}^2$, tells both how variable points are around the regression line, $\sigma^2$, and how variable the points are from the mean  
$\sigma_{\hat{\beta_1}}^2 = Var(\hat{\beta_1}) = \sigma^2/\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2$  
        + This implies spreaded out points will give a lower variance for a slope  
                - Thus large cluster of points very far apart would give the best variance, although this lm would assume the uncollected data between the clusters is linear  

* Variance of the intercept, $\sigma_{\hat{\beta_0}}^2$, is less informative but still can provide some information.  
$\sigma_{\hat{\beta_0}}^2 = Var(\hat{\beta}_0 = (\frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{X}^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \bar{X})^2})\sigma^2$  
* In both these cases, in practice, $\sigma$ is replaced by its estimate  
* Under iid gaussian errors, $\frac{\hat{\beta_j} - \beta_j}{\hat{\sigma_{\hat{\beta}_j}}}$, follows a $t$ distribution with $n - 2$ degrees of freedom and a normal distribution for large $n$  
        + This can be used to create confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests.  

### Coding Example  
* Showing R is calculating all these values as we have given  
```{r}
library(UsingR); data(diamond)
y <- diamond$price
x <- diamond$carat
n <- length(y)
beta1 <- cor(y, x) * sd(y) / sd(x) #Slope  
beta0 <- mean(y) - beta1 * mean(x) #y-intercept
e <- y - (beta0 + beta1 * x) #resids
sigma <- sqrt(sum(e^2) / (n-2)) #est. sd for resids
ssx <- sum((x - mean(x))^2) #Numerator of variance calculation
seBeta0 <- sqrt((1 / n + mean(x)^2 / ssx)) * sigma #s.e. of intercept
seBeta1 <- sigma / sqrt(ssx) #s.e. of slope 
tBeta0 <- beta0 / seBeta0 #t statistic for intercept; H_0: beta0=0
tBeta1 <- beta1 / seBeta1 # t statistic for slope
#Relevant p values
pBeta0 <-  2 * pt(abs(tBeta0), df = n - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
pBeta1 <-  2 * pt(abs(tBeta1), df = n - 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
coefTable <- rbind(c(beta0, seBeta0, tBeta0, pBeta0), c(beta1, seBeta1, tBeta1, pBeta1))
colnames(coefTable) <- c("Estimate", "Std. Error", "t value", "P(>|t|)")
rownames(coefTable) <- c("(Intercept)", "x")
coefTable
summary(lm(y ~ x))$coef
```
#### Generating Confidence Intervals
```{r}
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
sumCoef <- summary(fit)$coef

#Intercept
sumCoef[1, 1] + c(-1, 1) * qt(0.975, df = fit$df) * sumCoef[1, 2]

#Slope; Change in x per 1 y unit
sumCoef[2, 1] + c(-1, 1) * qt(0.975, df = fit$df) * sumCoef[2, 2]
```


### Prediction  
* Consider predicting $Y$ at a value of $X$  
        + Predicting the price of a diamond given the carat  
        + Predicting the height of a child given the height of the parents  
* The obvious estimate for prediction at point $x_0$ is $\hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}x_0$  
* A standard error is needed to create a prediction interval  
* There's a distinction between intervals for the regression line at points and the prediction of what a $y$ would be at point $x_0$  
* Line at $x_0$ std. error: $\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_0 - \bar{x})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2}}$  
        + Variance will be the least when predicting the average of x  
        + The denominator is how variable the 'x's are, so the more variability the less this error
* Prediction interval std. error at $x_0$: $\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_0 - \bar{x})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2}}$  

#### Generating Prediction Intervals in Diamond Data Set  
```{r}
newx <- data.frame(x = seq(min(x), max(x), length = 100))
##Data Wranglin'
p1 <- data.frame(predict(fit, newdata = newx, interval = ("confidence")))
p2 <- data.frame(predict(fit, newdata = newx, interval = ("prediction")))
#p1 is giving confidence for each interval
#p2 is giving the actual prediction at that data value

p1$interval = "confidence"
p2$interval = "prediction"
p1$x <- newx$x
p2$x <- newx$x
dat <- rbind(p1, p2)
names(dat)[1] <- "y"

##Plotting
plot <- ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) +
        geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, fill = interval), 
                    alpha = 0.4) +
        geom_line() +
        geom_point(data = data.frame(x = x, y = y), size = 4)
plot
```
* Blue is prediction area, salmon color is preciting the line at each spot.  
        + Both get narrower near middle since we're more confident as we are closer to the mean of x.  
        

### Lesson with `swirl()`: Introduction to Multivariable Regression 
* Once we identify one regression line we can eliminate it to reduce the dimensions of data  
* By subtracting the mean from each variable, the regression line goes through the orgin, hence its intercept is zero.  
        + thus we eliminate one of the two regressors, the constant, leaving just the predicting variable  
        + Subtracting the means is a special case of Gaussian Elimination  
                - We pick one regressor and replace all other varaibles by the residuals of their regressions against that one  
        + Subtracting the mean is equivalent to replacing a varaible by the residual of its regression against 1.  
                - as such `lm(child ~ 1, galton)` will give an intercept of the mean, with a slope of 0.    
                
#### Eliminate Variable Function  
* First we want a function to regress the given variable on the given predictor, suppressing the intercept, and return the residual.
```{r}
regressOneOnOne <- function(predictor, other, dataframe){
  # Point A. Create a formula such as Girth ~ Height -1
  formula <- paste0(other, " ~ ", predictor, " - 1")
  # Use the formula in a regression and return the residual.
  resid(lm(formula, dataframe))
}
```

* Using that function we can write another function to eliminate the specified predictor from the dataframe by regressing all other variables on that predictor and returning a data frame containing the residuals of those regressions.  
```{r}
eliminate <- function(predictor, dataframe){
  # Find the names of all columns except the predictor.
  others <- setdiff(names(dataframe), predictor)
  # Calculate the residuals of each when regressed against 
  # the given predictor with the previous function
  temp <- sapply(others, function(other)regressOneOnOne(predictor, other, dataframe))
  # convert matrix of resids to a data frame and return.
  as.data.frame(temp)
}
```

* We could use eliminate multiple times to get rid of more and more variables, each time essentially using Gaussian elimination to re-express all the terms such that they are plotted with the mean's intercection as the orgin. This in turn replaces the outcome and all other regressors by their residuals against the chosen variable.  


### Lesson with `swirl()`: MultiVar Examples  
* This data was gathered in 1888 in Switzerland, below are explaination fo the variables, all of which except fertility represent proportions of the population.  
        + Fertility - a common standardized fertility measure  
        + Agriculture - % of males involved in agriculture as occupation  
        + Examination - % draftees receiving highest mark on army examination  
        + Education - % education beyond primary school for draftees  
        + Catholic - % catholic (as opposed to protestant)  
        + Infant.Mortality - live births who live less than 1 year  
* Check out this 6 by 6 array of scatterplots showing pairwise relations between the variables.  
        + Lol, jk they just show the points plotted because I couldn't figure out `ggpairs`, I ought to use lattice for this task, but I'm just going to move on because I've spent enough time on it :(  
```{r message = FALSE}
data("swiss"); library(GGally)
ggpairs(swiss, lower = list(continous = "smooth"))
```

#### Reading Multiple Explanatory Variables  
```{r}
results <- summary(lm(Fertility ~ ., data = swiss))
results
```

* The `Coefficents` table states the Estimate/Slope for each explanatory variable to the dependent variable. For example:  
        + For every 1% increase in males involved in argiculture as an accupation we expect a .17 decrease in fertility, if all other variables are held constant.  
        + For every 1% increase in Catholisism we expect a .10 increase in fertility, if all other variables are held constant.  
        + For every 1% increase in education we expect a .87 decrease in fertility, if all other variables are held constant.
        + Etc., etc....  
        
* The astrieks indicate what level of significance that explanatory variable has on the dependent variable, fertility. For example the alpha level of the t-test for Agriculture has one \* as such it is significant at an alpha level of 0.05  

* Hoever, if only Agriculture is listed as the independent variable we will see the coefficent change to positive, indicating that sometimes additional variables can affect the influence of an independent vairable on a dependent one.  
```{r}
summary(lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture, swiss))$coef
```

* One last note: Adding additional, repeated info to a lm won't change the result, for example...
```{r}
extra <- (swiss$Education + swiss$Agriculture)
extraLM <- lm(Fertility ~. + extra, swiss)$coef
extraLM
lm(Fertility ~ ., swiss)$coef - extraLM
```
        
* The above code returns NA for extra because it gave no additional info to the linear model, and when substracting all the coefficients we can see there is no diffrence between the orginal and lm with `extra`  

## Quiz 2  
1. Given...  

```{r}
x <- c(0.61, 0.93, 0.83, 0.35, 0.54, 0.16, 0.91, 0.62, 0.62)
y <- c(0.67, 0.84, 0.6, 0.18, 0.85, 0.47, 1.1, 0.65, 0.36)
```
Give a P-value for the two sided hypothesis test of whether $\beta_1$ from a linear regression model is 0 or not  

```{r}
results <- summary(lm(y ~ x))
results$coefficients
```

* `r round(results$coefficients[2,4], 5)`  

2. Consider the previous problem, give the estimate of the residual standard deviation  

```{r}
results$sigma
```

3. In the `mtcars` data set, fit a linear regression model of weight (predictor) on mpg (outcome). Get a 95% confidence interval for the expected mpg at the average weight. What is the lower endpoint?    

```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
results <- predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(wt = mean(mtcars$wt)), 
        interval = "confidence")
results
```

* `r round(results[2], 3)`  

4. Refer to the help file for `mtcars`. What is the weight coefficient interpreted as?  
        * Expected change in mpg/1,000 lb increase in weight.  

5. Consider again the `mtcars` data set and a linear regression model with mpg as predicted by weight (1,000 lbs). A new car is coming weighing 3000 pounds. Construct a 95% **prediction** interval for its mpg. What is the upper endpoint?  

```{r}
results <- predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(wt = 3), 
        interval = "prediction")
results
```
        * `r round(results[3], 2)`  

6. Consider the `mtcars` data set again with mpg as predicted by weight. A “short” ton is defined as 2,000 lbs. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the expected change in mpg per 1 short ton increase in weight. Give the lower endpoint.  

```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ I(wt * 1000/2000), mtcars)
coefs <- summary(fit)$coef
inter <- coefs[2,1]
slope <- coefs[2,2]
slopeInterval <- inter + c(-1, 1) * qt(0.975, df = fit$df) * slope
slopeInterval
```

7. If my X from a linear regression is measured in centimeters and I convert it to meters what would happen to the slope coefficient?  
* Slope is *rise*/*run*, or *change in y*/*change in x* since we're changing the units of x we have to multiple by the conversion factor *100 cm*/*1 m*, which is to multiple the coefficent by 100.  

8. I have an outcome, $Y$, and a predictor, $X$ and fit a linear regression model with $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$ to obstain $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$. What would be the consequence to the subsequent slope and itnercept if I were to refit the model with a new regressor, $X + c$ for some constant, $c$?  

* $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon = \beta_0 - c\beta_1 + c\beta_1 + \beta_1X + \epsilon\\=\beta_0 - c\beta_1 + \beta_1(X+c) + \epsilon$  
        + As such this new intercept is $\beta_0 - c\beta_1$  

9. Refer back to the mtcars data set with mpg as an outcome and weight (wt) as the predictor. About what is the ratio of the the sum of the squared errors, $\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2$ when comparing a model with just an intercept (denominator) to the model with the intercept and slope (numerator)?  

```{r}
results <- summary(lm(mpg~wt, mtcars))
1 - results$r.squared
```

10. Do the residuals always have to sum to 0 in linear regression?  
* Yes, if an intercept is included in the resid.s  

# Multivariable Regression, Residuals, & Diagnostics  
## Multivariable Regression  
### Multivariable Regression Part 1  
#### Intro Scenerio Example  
* If one were to present evidence of a relationship between breath mint useage (mints per day, X) and pulmonary function (lung health measurement in FEV (Forced Expiratory Volume)) 
        + You may be skeptical, for smokers tend to use more breath mints than non-smokers, and smoking is related to a loss in pulmonary function.  
        + To conteract this skepticism one may want to investigate if non-smoking breath mint users had lower lung function than non-smoking non-breath mint users and if smoking breath mint suers had lower lung function than smoking non-breath mint users.  
        + In other words, to consider these results, we would have to demonstrate that the results hold when smoking status is held fixed.  
        
#### The Linear Model  
* How can one generalize Simple Linear Regression (SLR) to incorporate lots of regressors for the purpose of predictions?  
* Are there consequences for adding lots fo regressors?  
        + Omitting variables can cause incorrect predictions  
        + Adding too many variables into a model will eventually give 0 residuals, even if adding in random garbage predictors. This is called **over-fitting**  
* The general linear model extends SLR by adding terms linearly intot he model  
$Y_i = \beta_1X_{1i} + \beta_2X_{2i} + ... + \beta_pX_{pi} + \epsilon_i = \sum_{k=1}^p(X_{ik}\beta_j)+\epsilon_i$  
        + Here $X_{1i} = 1$ typically, so that an intercept is included.  
* Least squares (and hence Middle of Least squares estimates under iid Gaussianity of the errors) minimizes:  
$\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-\sum_{k=1}^pX_{ki}\beta_j)^2$
        + Note that the important linearity is linearity in the coefficients, thus:  
$Y_i = \beta_1X_{1i}^2 + \beta_2X_{2i}^2 + ... + \beta_pX_{pi}^2 + \epsilon_i$  
        + The above equation is still a linear model, we've just squared the element of the predictors  


### Multivariable Regression Part 2  
#### How to Get Estimates  
* Recall that the Least Squares estimate for regression through the origin, $E[Y_i] = X_{1i}\beta_1$, was $\sum(X_iY_i)/\sum X_i^2$   
* For two regressors we would have a regression line of $E[Y_i]=X_{1i}\beta_1 + X_{2i}\beta_2 = \mu_i$ and least squares would minimize $\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-X_{1i}\beta_1-X_{2i}\beta_2)^2$  
* With two independent variables, $X_1, X_2$, being used in a `lm` $X_1$ has to then be adjusted for $X_2$ being involved  
* So for the equation: $E[Y_i]=X_{1i}\hat{\beta_1} + X_{2i}\hat{\beta_2}$  
        + $\hat{\beta_1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(e_{i,Y|X_2} * e_{i, X_1|X_2})}{\sum_{i=1}^ne_{i,X_1|X_2}^2}$  
                - Remember that $e_i$ is just a col. vector of 0's except at the $i^{th}$ position, where there is a 1.  
        + Essentially the regression estimate for $\beta_1$ is the regression through the origin estimate having regressed $X_2$ out of both the response and the predictor.  
                - Similarly, the regression estimate for $\beta_2$ is the regression through the orgin estimate having regressed $X_1$ out of both the response and the predictor.  
        + Multivariate regression estimates are exactly those having removed the linear relationship of the other variables from both the regressor and response.  

* $Y_i = \beta_1 X_{1i}+\beta_2 X_{2i}$ where $X_{2i} = 1$ is an intercept term.  
* Notice the fitted coefficient of $X_{2i}$ on $Y_i$ is $\bar{Y}$  
        + The residuals $e_{i,Y|X_2} = Y_i - \bar{Y}$  
* Notice the fitted coefficient of $X_{2i}$ on $X{1i}$ is $\bar{X}_1$  
        + The residuals $e_{i,X_1|X_2} = X_{1i}-\bar{X}_1$  
* Thus  
$\hat{\beta_1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(e_{i,Y|X_2} * e_{i, X_1|X_2})}{\sum_{i=1}^ne_{i,X_1|X_2}^2} \\= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^2} \\= Cor(X,Y)\frac{Sd(Y)}{Sd(X)}$  

* For multiple variables this case just keeps adding terms, the least square solutions have to minimize:  
$\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-X_{1i}\beta_1 - ... - X_{pi}\beta_p)^2$  
        + The least squares estimate for the coefficeint of a multivariate regression model is exactly regression through the orgin with the linear relationships with the other regressors removed from both the regressor and outcome by taking residuals.  
        + In this sense, multivariate regression "adjusts" a coefficient for the linear impact of the other variables.  

### Multivariable Regression Continued  
#### Simulation
```{r}
set.seed(1618033)
n <- 100
x1 <- rnorm(n)
x2 <- rnorm(n)
x3 <- rnorm(n)
y <- 1 + x1 + x2 + x3 +
        rnorm(n, sd = .1) #rand. noise as \epsilon term
ey <- resid(lm(y ~ x2 + x3))
ex <- resid(lm(x1 ~ x2 + x3))
sum(ey * ex) / sum(ex ^ 2) #Reg. through orgin estimate
coef(lm(ey ~ ex - 1)) #Reg. est of ey to ex  
coef(lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3)) #Notice x1 is same as above
```

#### Interpretation of the Coeficients  
* Our model is $E[Y|X_1 = x_1,...,X_p=x_p] = \sum_{k=1}^p x_k\beta_k$  
        + Where $\beta_k$ is the coeffient for each $x_k$  
* The interpretation of a multivaraite regression coefficient is the expected change in the response per unit change in the regressor, holding all of the other regressors fixed. As such the diffrence between adding 1 to a regressor$_i$ and the orginal equation is just $\beta_i$, as seen below  
        + Adding 1: $E[Y|X_1 = x_1 + 1,...,X_p=x_p] =(x_1 + 1)\beta_1 + \sum_{k=2}^p x_k\beta_k$  
        + Difference: $(x_1 + 1)\beta_1 + \sum_{k=2}^px_k\beta_k - \sum_{k=1}^px_k\beta_k=\beta_1$  
  
#### Fitted Values, Residuals and Residual Variation  
ALL of our Simple Linear Regression (SLR) quantites can be extended to linear models of multiple dimensions  
* Model: $Y_i = \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik}\beta_k + \epsilon_i$ where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$  
* Fitted Responses: $\hat{Y}_i = \sum_{k=1}^pX_{ik}\hat{\beta}_k$  
* Residuals: $e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i$  
* Variance ewstiamte $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-p}\sum_{i=1}^ne_i^2$  
* To get predicted responses at new values, $x_1,...,x_p$ simply plug them into the linear model $\sum_{k=1}^px_k\hat{\beta}_k$  
* Each coefficient has their own standard error, $\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\beta}_k}$, and as such $\frac{\hat{\beta}_k-\beta_k}{\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\beta}_k}}$ follows a $T$ distribution with $n-p$ degrees of freedom  
* Predicted responses have standard errors and we can calculate predicted and expected rewsponse intervals.  
  
#### Linear Models Summary  
* Linear Models are the single most important applied statistical and amchine learning technique, *by far*.  
* They can...
        + decompose a signal into its harmonics  
        + flexibly fit complicated functions & curves.  
        + fit factor variables as predictors  
        + uncover complex multivariate relationships with the response  
        + build accurate prediction models  
 

## Multivariable Regression Tips and Tricks  
### Multivariable Regression Examples Part 1  
```{r}
library(datasets); data(swiss)
```
* `swiss` is a data frame with 47 observations on 6 variables  
1) *Fertility* - lg, a "common standardized fertility measure"  
2) *Agriculture* - % of males invovled in agriculture as occupation  
3) *Examination* - % of draftees receiving highest mark on army examination  
4) *Education* - % education beyond primary school for draftees  
5) *Catholic* - % catholic (as opposed to protestant)  
6) *Infant.Mortality* - % of live births who live less than 1 year  
  - All variables but *Fertility* give proportions of the population  
  - These data are from Switzerland in 1888 from 47 French-speaking "provinces"  
```{r}
all <- summary(lm(Fertility ~ . , data = swiss))
all$coefficients
```

* Each estimate would be interpreted as: Our model estimates an expected `Estimate` Increase/Decrease in standardized fertility for every 1% increase in percentage of `Explanatory Variable`  
* The `Std. Error` describes how precise the `Estimate` is  
* The t-test for $H_0:\beta_{Agri}=0$ versus $H_a:\beta_{Agri} \neq 0$ is significant.  
  + R gives the `t value` for this test and the `Pr(>|t|)`, P-value  
  
* Having only one predictor will change to coefficents  
```{r}
onlyAgri <- summary(lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture, data = swiss))
onlyAgri$coefficients

all$coefficients[1:2,]
```

* This diffrence when including new factors is a version of Simpson's paradox  

#### Simulation  
```{r}
set.seed(1618033)
n <- 100
x2 <- 1:n
x1 <- 0.01 * x2 + runif(n, -0.1, 0.1)
y <- -x1 + x2 + rnorm(n, sd = 0.01)
summary(lm(y ~ x1))$coef
```

* Only looking at `x1` doesn't show the underneath pattern generated from `x2` and gives a very large slope, however adding in `x2` ...  
```{r}
summary(lm(y ~ x1 + x2))$coef
```

* ... gives a more accurate representation of the true coefficients for `y`.  
* Let's do some plotting:  
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dat <- data.frame(y = y, x1 = x1, x2 = x2, 
                  ey = resid(lm(y ~ x2)), ex1 = resid(lm(x1 ~ x2)))
plot <- ggplot(dat, aes(x1, y, colour = x2)) +
  geom_point(colour = "#888888", size = 5) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, colour = "#000000") 
plot
```

* Although `y` grows with `x1` it can also be seen that `x2` grows as `x1` grows  
* Now let's look at the residuals of `y ~ x2` versus `x1 ~ x2`  
```{r}
residplot <- ggplot(dat, aes(ex1, ey, colour = x2)) +
  geom_point(colour = "#888888", size = 5) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, colour = "#000000") +
  geom_point(size = 4)
residplot
```

* This smoother has the slope of the `estimate` for `x1` above  

#### Back to `swiss` Data Set  
* The sign reverses itself witht the inclusion of Examinaiton and Education  
* The percent of males in the province working in agriculture is negatively related to educational attainment (correlation of -0.6395) and Educationa nd Examination (correlation of 0.6984) are obviously measuring similar things.  
  + Is the positive marginal an artifact for not having accounted for the Education level? (Education does have a strong effect, btw)  
* At the minimum, anyone claiming that provinces that focus more on agriculture have higher fertility rates would immediately be open to criticism due to these other cofactors present in the data.  


### Multivariable Regression Examples Part 2  
* Consider the linear model  
$Y_i = \beta_0 + X_{i1}\beta_i + \epsilon_i$  
  + Where each $X_{i1}$ is binary such that the value is 1 if measurement, $i$, is in a group and 0 otherwise.  
* Then for people in the group, $E[Y_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_1$  
* And for people not in the group, $E[Y_i] = \beta_0$  
  + As such the mean of the treated group is $\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1$  
  + Likewise, the mean for the control group is just $\hat{\beta}_0$  
* $\beta_1$ is interpretted as the increase or decrease in the mean of the treated group  
  + This also gives the inference for the two groups, the same value a 2-sample t-test would give you  

#### Comparing More Than 2 Levels  
* Since the value of $\beta_1$ gives the value of a 2-sample t-test, you can extend this to perform t-tests across multiple variables  
* Consider a multilevel factor level. For example a three level factor such as the US political party affiliation: Republican, Democrat, Independent.  
* $Y_i = \beta_0 + X_{i1}\beta_1+X_{i2}\beta_2+\epsilon_i$  
  + $X_{i1}$ is 1 for Republicans and 0 otherwise  
  + $X_{i2}$ is 1 for Democrats and 0 otherwise  
* If $i$ is **...** then $E[Y_i] = ...$  
  + **Republican** $= \beta_0 + \beta_1$  
  + **Democrat** $= \beta_0 + \beta_2$  
  + **Independent** $= \beta_0$  
* $\beta_1$ compares Republicans to Independents  
* $\beta_2$ compares Democrats to Independents  
* $\beta_1 - \beta_2$ compares Republicans to Democrats  
* (Choice of reference category changes the interpretation.)  

#### Example in R with InsectSprays  
```{r}
data(InsectSprays); library(tidyverse)
mus <- InsectSprays %>% group_by(spray) %>% summarise(mean = mean(count))
dat <- merge(InsectSprays, mus, by = "spray")
plot <- ggplot(dat, aes(spray, count, fill = spray)) +
  geom_violin(colour = "#000000", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Type of Spray", y = "Insect Count") +
  geom_point(aes(y=mean), shape = 17)
plot
```
  
* Fitting `count` as a response to `spray`, displaying mean with a triangle    
```{r}
res <- lm(count ~ spray, InsectSprays)
summary(res)$coef
```
  
* It can be seen that `sprayA` is missing, this is because all of the other sprays are in comparision to `sprayA`, so the estimate values are indicating the change of each spray relative to spray A  
* The average count of `sprayA` is just the `Estimate` of the `(Intercept)`  
* The average count of `sprayC` would be the `Estimate` of the `(Intercept)` plus the `Estimate` of `sprayC`, as seen below  
```{r}
c(summary(res)$coef[1,1], mus$mean[1])
c(summary(res)$coef[1,1] + summary(res)$coef[3,1], mus$mean[3])
```

#### Hard Coding the Dummy Variables  
```{r}
summary(lm(count ~
             I(1 * (spray == 'B')) + I(1 * (spray == 'C')) + 
             I(1 * (spray == 'D')) + I(1 * (spray == 'E')) + 
             I(1 * (spray == 'F')),
           data = InsectSprays))$coef
summary(res)$coef
```
  
* As such we can change what the $\beta_0$ spray is, aka the reference level  
```{r}
summary(lm(count ~
             I(1 * (spray == 'A')) + I(1 * (spray == 'B')) + 
             I(1 * (spray == 'D')) + I(1 * (spray == 'E')) + 
             I(1 * (spray == 'F')),
           data = InsectSprays))$coef
```
  
* Instead of typing all the factors one can just `relevel` the factors  
```{r}
spray_ <- relevel(InsectSprays$spray, "C")
summary(lm(count ~ spray_, data = InsectSprays))$coef
```
  
* Including all the parameters will just return `NA` for one of the parameters (In this case it would be for `sprayA`)  
* We can remove the intercept to get a set of all the levels  
```{r}
summary(lm(count ~ 0 + spray, data = InsectSprays))$coef
```
  
#### Summary  
* If we treat `spray` as a factor, R includes an intercept and omits the alphabetically first level of the factor.  
  + All t-tests are for comparisons of Sprays versus Spray A  
  + Emprirical mean for A is the `(Intercept)`  
  + Other group means are the intercept plus their coefficient  
* If we omit an intercept, then it includes terms for all levels of the factor.  
  + Group means are the coeffcients  
  + Tests are tests of whether the groups are different than zero.
* If we want comparisions between, say between Spray B and C, we could refit the model with C (or B) as the reference level.  

Additional Tid-bits on this data  
* Counts are counded from below by 0, which violates the assumption of normality of the errors.  
  + Also there are counts near 0, so both the actual assumption and the intent of the assumption are violated.  
* Variance does not appear to be constant  
* Perhaps taking logs of the counts would help.  
  + There are 0 counts, so perhaps `log(count + 1)`  
* Poisson GLMs for fitting count data will be covered later in this course.  
* Because of these issues our means are correct, but our inference would not be.  


### Multivariable Regression Examples Part 3  
We'll be looking at the `swiss` data set to see how we can translate a proportion to a binary variable  
```{r}
library(datasets); data(swiss)
##Create binary var from Catholic, 1 if > 50%, 0 o/w
dat <- swiss %>% mutate(CatholicBin = factor(1 * (Catholic > 50))) %>%
  select(Agriculture, Fertility, CatholicBin)
```
  
Now we can plot by subsets of variables  
```{r}
pal <- c("#5BC2E7", "#7851A9")
plot <- ggplot(dat, aes(Agriculture, Fertility, colour = CatholicBin)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = pal) +
  geom_point(size = 6, colour = "#000000") + geom_point(size = 4) +
  labs(x = "% in Agriculture", y = "Fertility") 
plot
```
  
#### Fitting the Model  
* $y = Fertility$  
* $x_1 = Agriculture$  
* $x_2 = \text{1 if over .50 Catholic, 0 otherwise}$  
Then our model could be:  
* $E[y|x_1x_2] = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2$  
Which would give us the expected values of:  
* $E[y|x_2=0] = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1$  
* $E[y|x_2=1] = \beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_1x_1$  
These two models have the same slope, $\beta_1$, but different intercepts.  
To make a model that has diffrent slopes we could fit it as such:  
* $E[y|x_1x_2] = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_1x_2$  
We then have the following expected values:  
* $E[y|x_2=0] = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1$  
* $E[y|x_2=1] = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3x_1\\=\beta_0 + \beta_2 + (\beta_1 + \beta_3)x_1$  
These models now have both different intercepts and slopes because we included an **interaction term**, $\beta_3x_1x_2$  

### Multivariable Regression Examples Part 4  
We'll now look an example of a model with an **interaction term**  
```{r}
##Fitting without CatholicBin
fafit <- lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture, data = dat)
plot + geom_abline(intercept = coef(fafit)[1], 
                   slope = coef(fafit)[2], size = 2)
```

```{r}
##Fitting first proposed model
facfit <- lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture + CatholicBin, data = dat)
plot + geom_abline(intercept = coef(facfit)[1], slope = coef(facfit)[2],
                   size = 2, colour = pal[1]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = coef(facfit)[1] + coef(facfit)[3], 
              slope = coef(facfit)[2], size = 2, colour = pal[2])
```
  
```{r}
##Fitting model with diffrent slopes  
interactfit <- lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture * CatholicBin, dat)
##Let's look at the coef.s before tossing them all in
summary(interactfit)$coef
coef(interactfit)
```
* We can see here that `R` has automaticly made 3 variables: $x_1$, Agriculture; $x_2$, CatholicBin; and $x_3$, Agriculture*CatholicBin.  
```{r}
plot + geom_abline(intercept = coef(interactfit)[1], 
                   slope = coef(interactfit)[2], 
                   size = 2, colour = pal[1]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = coef(interactfit)[1] + coef(interactfit)[3],#Int.Var
              slope = coef(interactfit)[2] + coef(interactfit)[4],
              size = 2, colour = pal[2])
```

  + The X cariable is unrelated to group status, t  
  + The X variable is related to Y, but the intercept depends on group status  
  + The group variable is related to Y  
    - The relationship between group status and Y is constant depending on X  
    - The relationship between group and Y disregarding X is about the same as holding X constant  

#### Simulation 2  
```{r}
x <- c(runif(n/2), 1.5 + runif(n/2))
tau <- 0
y <- beta0 + x * beta1 + t * tau + rnorm(n, sd = sigma)
plot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y, section = factor(t)), 
               aes(x,y, colour = section)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = pal) +
  geom_point(size = 3, colour = "#000000") +
  geom_point(size = 2)
plot
```
```{r}
xfit <- lm(y ~ x)
xtfit <- lm(y ~ x + t)
plot + geom_abline(intercept = xfit$coef[1], slope = xfit$coef[2])
plot +
  geom_abline(intercept = xtfit$coef[1], slope = xtfit$coef[2], 
              colour = pal[1]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = xtfit$coef[1] + xtfit$coef[3],
              slope = xtfit$coef[2], colour = pal[2])
```
```{r}
xfit$coefficients
xtfit$coefficients
```
  
* These lines look nearly the same with only a slightly different intercept. However, the X variable is highly related to group status, below 1 is section `0` and above 1.5 is section `1`.  
* The X variable is realted to Y, and the intercept does not depend on the group varaible  
  + The X variable remains related to Y holding group status constant  
* The group variable is marginally related to Y disregarding X  
* The model would estimate no adjusted effect due to group.  
  + There isn't any data to inform the relationship between group and Y.  
  + This conclusion is entirely based on the model  
* This sort of model may occur if the x-variable is something related to being in the given section.  

#### Simulation 3  
```{r}
x <- c(runif(n/2), 0.9 + runif(n/2))
tau <- -1
y <- beta0 + x * beta1 + t * tau + rnorm(n, sd = sigma)
plot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y, section = factor(t)), 
               aes(x,y, colour = section)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = pal) +
  geom_point(size = 3, colour = "#000000") +
  geom_point(size = 2)
plot
```
```{r}
##Fitting a model
xfit <- lm(y ~ x)
xtfit <- lm(y ~ x + t)
plot + geom_abline(intercept = xfit$coef[1], slope = xfit$coef[2]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = xtfit$coef[1], slope = xtfit$coef[2], 
              colour = pal[1]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = xtfit$coef[1] + xtfit$coef[3],
              slope = xtfit$coef[2], colour = pal[2])
```
  
* Here we can see subsetting by group gives a clearly diffrent slope and still has some shared x values between groups. They also have diffrent intercepts  
* This is an example of Simpson's "paradox"  

#### Simulation 4  
```{r}
x <- c(0.5 + runif(n/2), runif(n/2))
tau <- 1
y <- beta0 + x * beta1 + t * tau + rnorm(n, sd = sigma)
plot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y, section = factor(t)), 
               aes(x,y, colour = section)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = pal) +
  geom_point(size = 3, colour = "#000000") +
  geom_point(size = 2)
plot
```
```{r}
##Fitting a model
xfit <- lm(y ~ x)
xtfit <- lm(y ~ x + t)
plot + geom_abline(intercept = xfit$coef[1], slope = xfit$coef[2]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = xtfit$coef[1], slope = xtfit$coef[2], 
              colour = pal[1]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = xtfit$coef[1] + xtfit$coef[3],
              slope = xtfit$coef[2], colour = pal[2])
```
  
* In this example there is a large affect when adjusted for x, however the marginal affect is not great with mean(section==0) = `r round(mean(y[1:(n/2 - 1)]), 4)` and mean(section==1) = `r round(mean(y[n/2:n]), 4)`. Group status is not realted to X much with all the overlap.  

#### Simulation 5  
```{r}
x <- c(runif(n/2, -1, 1), runif(n/2, -1, 1))
tau <- 0
tau1 <- -4
y <- beta0 + x * beta1 + t * tau + t * x * tau1 + rnorm(n, sd = sigma)
plot <- ggplot(data.frame(x = x, y = y, section = factor(t)), 
               aes(x,y, colour = section)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = pal) +
  geom_point(size = 3, colour = "#000000") +
  geom_point(size = 2)
plot
```
```{r}
##Fitting a model
xfit <- lm(y ~ x)
xtfit <- lm(y ~ x + t + I(x * t))
plot + geom_abline(intercept = xfit$coef[1], slope = xfit$coef[2]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = xtfit$coef[1], slope = xtfit$coef[2], 
              colour = pal[1]) +
  geom_abline(intercept = xtfit$coef[1] + xtfit$coef[3],
              slope = xtfit$coef[2] + xtfit$coef[4], 
              colour = pal[2])
```
```{r}
c(mean(y[1:(n/2 - 1)]), mean(y[n/2:n]))
```
  
* Here the marginal difference is quite small, however looking at the trend by group shows that section `1` has a decrease in Y as X increases. However the intercept is quite high. As such one couldn't advise for a treatment if an individual had a low x.  

#### Some final thoughts  
* Modeling multivariate relationships is difficult  
* Play around with simulations to see how the inclusion or exclusion of another variable can change analyses  
* The results of these analyses deal witht eh impact of variables on associations  
  + Ascertaining mechanisms or cause are difficult subjects to be added on top of difficulty in understanding multivariate associations
